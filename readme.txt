2. Set the directories /yoursite/wp-content/plugins/php-image-editor-lite/editimagesoriginal/, /yoursite/wp-content/plugins/php-image-editor-lite/editimagespng/ and /yoursite/wp-content/plugins/php-image-editor-lite/editimagesworkwith/ to read, write, and execute permissions.

3. If you already havenÂ´t done it, set your own image directory, subdirectories to read, write, and execute permissions. For example /yoursite/wp-content/uploads/

Important! CHMOD 777 ain't secure. You could try CHMOD 755. Read more at: http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions
